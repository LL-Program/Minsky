## About Minsky

Minsky is a hobby-project of mine trying to createa simple to configure code editor, which is written in Python, to easily modify it and write plug-ins for it.

It should behave and feel like vscode but with vim and neovim aspects including theme-cusomizability, to give each editor a personality.
